## Nuget package library NUnit by Charlie Poole,  Rob Prouse

NUnit is a unit-testing framework for all .NET languages.
            It can run on macOS, Linux and Windows operating systems.
            NUnit can be used for a wide range of testing, from unit testing with TDD to full-fledged system and integration testing.
            It is a non-opinionated, broad and deep framework with multiple different ways to assert that your code behaves as expected. Many aspects of NUnit can be extended to suit your specific purposes.

            The latest version, version 4, is an upgrade from the groundbreaking NUnit 3 framework. It is a modernized version, aimed at taking advantage of the latest .NET features and C# language constructs.

            If you are upgrading from NUnit 3, be aware of the breaking changes (https://docs.nunit.org/articles/nunit/release-notes/breaking-changes.html#nunit-40). Please see the NUnit 4 Migration Guide (https://docs.nunit.org/articles/nunit/release-notes/Nunit4.0-MigrationGuide.html) and take care to prepare your NUnit 3 code before you do the upgrade.

            Supported platforms:
            - .NET Framework 4.6.2+
            - .NET 6.0+
            - .NET 8.0+

      Note that this package ONLY contains the adapter, not the NUnit framework.
      For VS 2017 and forward, you should add this package to every test project in your solution. (Earlier versions only require a single adapter package per solution.)

## Nuget package library log4net by The Apache Software Foundation

log4net is a tool to help the programmer output log statements to a variety of output targets.
In case of problems with an application, it is helpful to enable logging so that the problem
can be located. With log4net it is possible to enable logging at runtime without modifying the
application binary. The log4net package is designed so that log statements can remain in
shipped code without incurring a high performance cost. It follows that the speed of logging
(or rather not logging) is crucial.

At the same time, log output can be so voluminous that it quickly becomes overwhelming.
One of the distinctive features of log4net is the notion of hierarchical loggers.
Using these loggers it is possible to selectively control which log statements are output
at arbitrary granularity.

log4net is designed with two distinct goals in mind: speed and flexibility

## Nuget package library Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.TraceEvent by Microsoft

Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) is a powerful logging mechanism built into the Windows OS and is used extensively in Windows. 
      You can also log ETW events yourself code using the System.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource class.

      The TraceEvent library conains the classes needed to control ETW providers (including .NET EventSources) 
      and parse the events they emit.

      The library includes
      -- TraceEventSession which can enable ETW providers,
      -- EtwTraceEventSource which lets you read the stream of ETW events, and
      -- TraceLog which is is digested form of ETW events which include decoded stack traces associated with the events.

            NUnit can be used for a wide range of testing, from unit testing with TDD to full-fledged system and integration testing.
            It is a non-opinionated, broad and deep framework with multiple different ways to assert that your code behaves as expected. Many aspects of NUnit can be extended to suit your specific purposes.

            The latest version, version 4, is an upgrade from the groundbreaking NUnit 3 framework. It is a modernized version, aimed at taking advantage of the latest .NET features and C# language constructs.

            If you are upgrading from NUnit 3, be aware of the breaking changes (https://docs.nunit.org/articles/nunit/release-notes/breaking-changes.html#nunit-40). Please see the NUnit 4 Migration Guide (https://docs.nunit.org/articles/nunit/release-notes/Nunit4.0-MigrationGuide.html) and take care to prepare your NUnit 3 code before you do the upgrade.

            Supported platforms:
            - .NET Framework 4.6.2+
