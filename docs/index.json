It can run on macOS, Linux and Windows operating systems. NUnit can be used for a wide range of testing, from unit testing with TDD to full-fledged system and integration testing. It is a non-opinionated, broad and deep framework with multiple different ways to assert that your code behaves as expected. Many aspects of NUnit can be extended to suit your specific purposes. The latest version, version 4, is an upgrade from the groundbreaking NUnit 3 framework. It is a modernized version, aimed at taking advantage of the latest .NET features and C# language constructs. If you are upgrading from NUnit 3, be aware of the breaking changes (https://docs.nunit.org/articles/nunit/release-notes/breaking-changes.html#nunit-40). Please see the NUnit 4 Migration Guide (https://docs.nunit.org/articles/nunit/release-notes/Nunit4.0-MigrationGuide.html) and take care to prepare your NUnit 3 code before you do the upgrade.

Note that this package ONLY contains the adapter, not the NUnit framework. For VS 2017 and forward, you should add this package to every test project in your solution. (Earlier versions only require a single adapter package per solution.)

If applied to a parameter, indicates that the parameter is an MVC view component. If applied to a method, the MVC view name is calculated implicitly from the context. Use this attribute for custom wrappers similar to System.Web.Mvc.Controller.View(Object). AspMvcViewComponentAttribute ASP.NET MVC attribute. If applied to a parameter, indicates that the parameter is an MVC view component name. AspMvcViewComponentViewAttribute ASP.NET MVC attribute. If applied to a parameter, indicates that the parameter is an MVC view component view. If applied to a method, the MVC view component view name is default. AspMvcViewLocationFormatAttribute AspRequiredAttributeAttribute AspTypePropertyAttribute AssertionConditionAttribute Indicates the condition parameter of the assertion method. The method itself should be marked by AssertionMethodAttribute attribute. The mandatory argument of the attribute is the assertion type. AssertionMethodAttribute Indicates that the marked method is assertion method, i.e. it halts the control flow if one of the conditions is satisfied. To set the condition, mark one of the parameters with AssertionConditionAttribute attribute. BaseAppBuilder Base class for IAppBuilder implementations BaseDebugAppBuilder Base class for IAppBuilder implementations to be used for setting up test projects BaseTypeRequiredAttribute When applied to a target attribute, specifies a requirement for any type marked with the target attribute to implement or inherit specific type or types. CanBeNullAttribute Indicates that the value of the marked element could be null sometimes, so checking for null is required before its usage. CannotApplyEqualityOperatorAttribute Indicates that the value of the marked type (or its derivatives) cannot be compared using '==' or '!=' operators and Equals() should be used instead. However, using '==' or '!=' for comparison with null is always permitted. CollectionAccessAttribute Indicates how method, constructor invocation, or property access over collection type affects the contents of the collection. Use CollectionAccessType to specify the access type. ContractAnnotationAttribute Describes dependency between method input and output. DefaultAppStartProvider Default app start provider reading configuration, creating app start parameter and creating logger as defined in configuration GeneralAppManagementManager Implementation of general app services like database backup GeneralAppManagementService Basic implementation of general app services like database backup HtmlAttributeValueAttribute HtmlElementAttributesAttribute InstantHandleAttribute Tells code analysis engine if the parameter is completely handled when the invoked method is on stack. If the parameter is a delegate, indicates that delegate is executed while the method is executed. If the parameter is an enumerable, indicates that it is enumerated while the method is executed. InvokerParameterNameAttribute Indicates that the function argument should be a string literal and match one of the parameters of the caller function. For example, ReSharper annotates the parameter of ArgumentNullException. ItemCanBeNullAttribute Can be applied to symbols of types derived from IEnumerable as well as to symbols of Task and Lazy classes to indicate that the value of a collection item, of the Task.Result property or of the Lazy.Value property can be null. ItemNotNullAttribute Can be applied to symbols of types derived from IEnumerable as well as to symbols of Task and Lazy classes to indicate that the value of a collection item, of the Task.Result property or of the Lazy.Value property can never be null. LicenseMissingArgs LinqTunnelAttribute Indicates that method is pure LINQ method, with postponed enumeration (like Enumerable.Select, .Where). This annotation allows inference of [InstantHandle] annotation for parameters of delegate type by analyzing LINQ method chains. LocalizationRequiredAttribute Indicates whether the marked element should be localized. MacroAttribute Allows specifying a macro for a parameter of a source template. MeansImplicitUseAttribute Can be applied to attributes, type parameters, and parameters of a type assignable from Type . When applied to an attribute, the decorated attribute behaves the same as UsedImplicitlyAttribute. When applied to a type parameter or to a parameter of type Type, indicates that the corresponding type is used implicitly. MustUseReturnValueAttribute Indicates that the return value of the method invocation must be used. NoEnumerationAttribute Indicates that IEnumerable passed as a parameter is not enumerated. Use this annotation to suppress the 'Possible multiple enumeration of IEnumerable' inspection. NoReorderAttribute Prevents the Member Reordering feature from tossing members of the marked class. NotNullAttribute Indicates that the value of the marked element can never be null. NotifyPropertyChangedInvocatorAttribute Indicates that the method is contained in a type that implements System.ComponentModel.INotifyPropertyChanged interface and this method is used to notify that some property value changed. PathReferenceAttribute Indicates that a parameter is a path to a file or a folder within a web project. Path can be relative or absolute, starting from web root (~). ProvidesContextAttribute Indicates the type member or parameter of some type, that should be used instead of all other ways to get the value of that type. This annotation is useful when you have some \"context\" value evaluated and stored somewhere, meaning that all other ways to get this value must be consolidated with existing one. PublicAPIAttribute This attribute is intended to mark publicly available API which should not be removed and so is treated as used. PureAttribute Indicates that a method does not make any observable state changes. The same as System.Diagnostics.Contracts.PureAttribute. RazorDirectiveAttribute RazorHelperCommonAttribute RazorImportNamespaceAttribute RazorInjectionAttribute RazorLayoutAttribute RazorPageBaseTypeAttribute RazorSectionAttribute Razor attribute. Indicates that the marked parameter or method is a Razor section. Use this attribute for custom wrappers similar to System.Web.WebPages.WebPageBase.RenderSection(String). RazorWriteLiteralMethodAttribute RazorWriteMethodAttribute RazorWriteMethodParameterAttribute RegexPatternAttribute Indicates that the marked parameter is a regular expression pattern. SourceTemplateAttribute An extension method marked with this attribute is processed by code completion as a 'Source Template'. When the extension method is completed over some expression, its source code is automatically expanded like a template at call site. StringFormatMethodAttribute Indicates that the marked method builds string by the format pattern and (optional) arguments. The parameter, which contains the format string, should be given in constructor. The format string should be in Format(IFormatProvider, string, params object[])-like form. TerminatesProgramAttribute Indicates that the marked method unconditionally terminates control flow execution. For example, it could unconditionally throw exception. UiMessages Messages for WinForms UI and console UsedImplicitlyAttribute Indicates that the marked symbol is used implicitly (e.g. via reflection, in external library), so this symbol will not be reported as unused (as well as by other usage inspections). ValueProviderAttribute Use this annotation to specify a type that contains static or const fields with values for the annotated property/field/parameter. The specified type will be used to improve completion suggestions. XamlItemBindingOfItemsControlAttribute XAML attribute. Indicates the property of some BindingBase-derived type, that is used to bind some item of ItemsControl-derived type. This annotation will enable the DataContext type resolve for XAML bindings for such properties. XamlItemsControlAttribute XAML attribute. Indicates the type that has ItemsSource property and should be treated as ItemsControl-derived type, to enable inner items DataContext type resolve. Enums AssertionConditionType Specifies assertion type. If the assertion method argument satisfies the condition, then the execution continues. Otherwise, execution is assumed to be halted. CollectionAccessType Provides a value for the CollectionAccessAttribute to define how the collection method invocation affects the contents of the collection. ImplicitUseKindFlags Specify the details of implicitly used symbol when it is marked with MeansImplicitUseAttribute or UsedImplicitlyAttribute. ImplicitUseTargetFlags Specify what is considered to be used implicitly when marked with MeansImplicitUseAttribute or UsedImplicitlyAttribute."

    "summary": "Typography Bodoconsult.App.Abstractions.TypographyBase is a base class implementing ITypography containing properties and methods around typographic settings for paper reports and / or charts. The itention of this library is to store a complete typographic set of properties outside the app in an adjustable JSON file and to read it from there if needed. The library contains three predefined typographic sets for common use cases in the classes called DefaultTypographyPageHeader, CompactTypographyPageHeader and ElegantTypographyPageHeader. The default paper format is DIN A4 portrait. DefaultTypographyPageHeader is a typographic style set for a normal paper report. It is a compromiss between use of space and elegance. CompactTypographyPageHeader is a typographic style set for compact paper report intended to get as much information as possible on a given paper format. ElegantTypographyPageHeader is a typograhic style set preferring elegance over use of space. It needs more pages of paper per given information to print. How to use the library The source code contain NUnit test classes, the following source code is extracted from. The samples below show the most helpful use cases for the library. Basic usage var t = new ElegantTypographyPageHeader(\"Cambria\", \"Cambria\", \"Cambria\") { LogoPath = @\"C:\\bodoconsult\\Logos\\logo.jpg\" }; t.SetMargins(); Customizing a typographic set var t = new ElegantTypographyPageHeader(\"Cambria\", \"Cambria\", \"Cambria\") { LogoPath = @\"C:\\bodoconsult\\Logos\\logo.jpg\", FontSize = 12, }; t.SetMargins(); Creating your user-defined typographic set The following example shows the implementation of a user-defined typographic set. /// <summary> /// Provides your user-defined typograph based on sans serif fonts at default.

Using app start infrastructure for a console app employing a WPF dispatcher If you want to use WPF features like FlowDocuments in a console app you need to employ a WPF dispatcher. In a classical WPF app starting the WPF dispatcher is done by the App.xaml start process internally. In a console app you do not have a App.xaml so the disptacher has to be started separately. Using Bodoconsult.App.Wpf you can handles this easily. Here a sample from Program.cs Main() how to setup the console app employing a WPF dispatcher in project ConsoleWpfApp1 contained in this repo: var globals = Globals.Instance; globals.LoggingConfig.AddDefaultLoggerProviderConfiguratorsForConsoleApp(); // Set additional app start parameters as required var param = globals.AppStartParameter; param.AppName = \"ConsoleWpfApp1: Demo app\"; param.SoftwareTeam = \"Robert Leisner\"; param.AppFolderName = \"ConsoleWpfApp1\"; const string performanceToken = \"--PERF\"; if (args.Contains(performanceToken)) { param.IsPerformanceLoggingActivated = true; } // Now start app buiding process IAppBuilder builder = new ConsoleWpfApp1AppBuilder(globals); #if !DEBUG AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException += builder.CurrentDomainOnUnhandledException; #endif // Load basic app metadata builder.LoadBasicSettings(typeof(Program)); // Process the config file builder.ProcessConfiguration(); // Now load the globally needed settings builder.LoadGlobalSettings(); // Write first log entry with default logger Globals.Instance.Logger.LogInformation($\"{param.AppName} {param.AppVersion} starts...\"); Console.WriteLine(\"Logging started...\"); // Prepare the DI container package builder.LoadDiContainerServiceProviderPackage(); builder.RegisterDiServices(); builder.FinalizeDiContainerSetup(); // Now finally start the app and wait builder.StartApplication(); Environment.Exit(0); Start by creating your own app builder class similar to ConsoleWpfApp1AppBuilder class based on BaseConsoleWpfAppBuilderl. Using app start infrastructure for a OS service like WPF based apps If you want to implement a OS service like application without implementing a real OS service you can use WpfStarterUi class. By default WpfStarterUi class loads the app as a simple window not shown on Windows task bar but task tray. The app can be closed only with keys STRC + C / CTRL + C or from task tray. Here a sample from App.Xaml.cs OnStartup() how to setup the WPF console app in project WpfConsoleApp1 contained in this repo: var type = typeof(App); Debug.Print(\"Hello, World!\"); Console.WriteLine(\"WpfConsoleApp1 initiation starts...\"); var globals = Globals.Instance; globals.LoggingConfig.AddDefaultLoggerProviderConfiguratorsForUiApp(); // Set additional app start parameters as required var param = globals.AppStartParameter; param.AppName = \"WpfConsoleApp1: Demo app\"; param.SoftwareTeam = \"Robert Leisner\"; param.LogoRessourcePath = \"WpfConsoleApp1.Resources.logo.jpg\"; param.AppFolderName = \"WpfConsoleApp1\"; const string performanceToken = \"--PERF\"; if (e.Args.Contains(performanceToken)) { param.IsPerformanceLoggingActivated = true; } // Now start app buiding process var builder = new WpfConsoleApp1AppBuilder(globals); #if !DEBUG AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException += builder.CurrentDomainOnUnhandledException; #endif // Load basic app metadata builder.LoadBasicSettings(type); // Process the config file builder.ProcessConfiguration(); // Now load the globally needed settings builder.LoadGlobalSettings(); // Write first log entry with default logger Globals.Instance.Logger.LogInformation($\"{param.AppName} {param.AppVersion} starts...\"); Console.WriteLine(\"Logging started...\"); // Prepare the DI container package builder.LoadDiContainerServiceProviderPackage(); builder.RegisterDiServices(); builder.FinalizeDiContainerSetup(); // Create the viewmodel now var eventLevel = EventLevel.Warning; var listener = new AppEventListener(eventLevel); var viewModel = new MainWindowViewModel(listener) { HeaderBackColor = Colors.Coral, AppExe = param.AppExe }; // Load the logo now viewModel.LoadLogo(type.Assembly, param.LogoRessourcePath); // Set the view model builder.MainWindowViewModel = viewModel; // Now finally start the app and wait builder.StartApplication(); base.OnStartup(e); About us Bodoconsult http://www.bodoconsult.de is a Munich based software company from Germany.

Using app start infrastructure for a console app employing a WPF dispatcher If you want to use WPF features like FlowDocuments in a console app you need to employ a WPF dispatcher. In a classical WPF app starting the WPF dispatcher is done by the App.xaml start process internally. In a console app you do not have a App.xaml so the disptacher has to be started separately. Using Bodoconsult.App.Wpf you can handles this easily. Here a sample from Program.cs Main() how to setup the console app employing a WPF dispatcher in project ConsoleAvaloniaApp1 contained in this repo: var globals = Globals.Instance; globals.LoggingConfig.AddDefaultLoggerProviderConfiguratorsForConsoleApp(); // Set additional app start parameters as required var param = globals.AppStartParameter; param.AppName = \"ConsoleAvaloniaApp1: Demo app\"; param.SoftwareTeam = \"Robert Leisner\"; param.AppFolderName = \"ConsoleAvaloniaApp1\"; const string performanceToken = \"--PERF\"; if (args.Contains(performanceToken)) { param.IsPerformanceLoggingActivated = true; } // Now start app buiding process IAppBuilder builder = new ConsoleAvaloniaApp1AppBuilder(globals); #if !DEBUG AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException += builder.CurrentDomainOnUnhandledException; #endif // Load basic app metadata builder.LoadBasicSettings(typeof(Program)); // Process the config file builder.ProcessConfiguration(); // Now load the globally needed settings builder.LoadGlobalSettings(); // Write first log entry with default logger Globals.Instance.Logger.LogInformation($\"{param.AppName} {param.AppVersion} starts...\"); Console.WriteLine(\"Logging started...\"); // Prepare the DI container package builder.LoadDiContainerServiceProviderPackage(); builder.RegisterDiServices(); builder.FinalizeDiContainerSetup(); // Now finally start the app and wait builder.StartApplication(); Environment.Exit(0); Start by creating your own app builder class similar to ConsoleAvaloniaApp1AppBuilder class based on BaseConsoleAvaloniaAppBuilderl. Using app start infrastructure for a OS service like WPF based apps If you want to implement a OS service like application without implementing a real OS service you can use WpfStarterUi class. By default WpfStarterUi class loads the app as a simple window not shown on Windows task bar but task tray. The app can be closed only with keys STRC + C / CTRL + C or from task tray. Here a sample from App.Xaml.cs OnStartup() how to setup the WPF console app in project WpfConsoleApp1 contained in this repo: var type = typeof(App); Debug.Print(\"Hello, World!\"); Console.WriteLine(\"WpfConsoleApp1 initiation starts...\"); var globals = Globals.Instance; globals.LoggingConfig.AddDefaultLoggerProviderConfiguratorsForUiApp(); // Set additional app start parameters as required var param = globals.AppStartParameter; param.AppName = \"WpfConsoleApp1: Demo app\"; param.SoftwareTeam = \"Robert Leisner\"; param.LogoRessourcePath = \"WpfConsoleApp1.Resources.logo.jpg\"; param.AppFolderName = \"WpfConsoleApp1\"; const string performanceToken = \"--PERF\"; if (e.Args.Contains(performanceToken)) { param.IsPerformanceLoggingActivated = true; } // Now start app buiding process var builder = new WpfConsoleApp1AppBuilder(globals); #if !DEBUG AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException += builder.CurrentDomainOnUnhandledException; #endif // Load basic app metadata builder.LoadBasicSettings(type); // Process the config file builder.ProcessConfiguration(); // Now load the globally needed settings builder.LoadGlobalSettings(); // Write first log entry with default logger Globals.Instance.Logger.LogInformation($\"{param.AppName} {param.AppVersion} starts...\"); Console.WriteLine(\"Logging started...\"); // Prepare the DI container package builder.LoadDiContainerServiceProviderPackage(); builder.RegisterDiServices(); builder.FinalizeDiContainerSetup(); // Create the viewmodel now var eventLevel = EventLevel.Warning; var listener = new AppEventListener(eventLevel); var viewModel = new MainWindowViewModel(listener) { HeaderBackColor = Colors.Coral, AppExe = param.AppExe }; // Load the logo now viewModel.LoadLogo(type.Assembly, param.LogoRessourcePath); // Set the view model builder.MainWindowViewModel = viewModel; // Now finally start the app and wait builder.StartApplication(); base.OnStartup(e); About us Bodoconsult http://www.bodoconsult.de is a Munich based software company from Germany.

    "title": "Business transactions with IBusinessTransactionManager / BusinessTransactionManager | Bodoconsult.AppInfrastructure",
    "summary": "Business transactions with IBusinessTransactionManager / BusinessTransactionManager Overview A business transaction is defined here as an external call for a certain functionality of an app by a UI client, webservice or any other client of the app. BusinessTransactionManager class is intended as central point for inbound business transactions for the app. At least each external call via technologies like GRPC or Webservice should be a business transaction. BusinessTransactionManager delivers central features like logging and performance measurement to external request to your app. So it helps to simplify external interface classes using technologies like GRPC, WebAPI or Webservice by keeping business logic out of them. Imaging you have to develop an server app based on a database. The server app has a GUI and a separate webservice app connected via GRPC as transportation technology. The transportation layer is accessing directly the business logic layer. With a well disciplined dev team this is no big deal. It maps the Protobuf DTO coming from GUI or webservice to an internal DTO and forwards it to the business logic. The approach of accesing business logic directly from transportation layer will work well basically but has some drawbacks in every case: You have to implement a GRPC related method in the transportation for each separate request. This blows up the source code and is expensive for resssources like RAM Request logging has to be done in each of this GRPC related request methods separately Handling request meta data like ClientId or User has to be done in each of this GRPC related request methods separately With an unexperienced dev team the danger of having transportation layer dependencies like GRPC spread all over the source code is growing With an unexperienced dev team the danger of having buisness logic implemented directly in transportation layer is growing All of the above points lead to uncessary source code to be maintained and shrinking testabililty up to untestability. Using business transactions addresses all of the above points. You need only one GRPC method for receiving the business transaction request Central handling of logging and basic error handling Central handling of request meta data like ClientId or User Clear separation of business logic layer and transportation layer Lightweight implementation of the business transaction layer Business transaction can be used app internally too. For short running business transactions the GRPC request can directly wait for an answer. This is a syncronous working behavior. For longer running business transactions it is potentially possible to implement a back channel to the client or webservice via GRPC and provide the result of the business transaction with its unique ID. With this ID the receiver can handle the result correctly as it is possible to nake a relation between the original request and the late coming reply. This is an asyncronous working behavior. Base class BusinessTransaction Base class for business transactions is the class BusinessTransaction with the main properties Id, Name and RunBusinessTransactionDelegate. RunBusinessTransactionDelegate is the binding member from business transactions to the business logic. /// <summary> /// Represents a business transaction that can be called from a client the current app /// </summary> public class BusinessTransaction { /// <summary> /// A unique transaction ID. Transaction are called by this ID by the client /// </summary> public int Id { get; set; } /// <summary> /// Name of the transaction /// </summary> public string Name { get; set; } /// <summary> /// Error code the transaction should return. Default: 0 means no error /// </summary> public int ErrorCode { get; set; } = 0; /// <summary> /// The error message the transaction should return /// </summary> public string ErrorMessage { get; set; } /// <summary> /// The business logic method that should be called for the current transaction /// </summary> public RunBusinessTransactionDelegate RunBusinessTransactionDelegate { get; set; } /// <summary> /// Do not add an event counter for this transaction /// </summary> public bool NoEventCounter { get; set; } = false; } Sample implementation of a business transaction provider An app using the business transactions should define a set of IBusinessTransactionProvider based classes providing the logic for the required business transactions. This set of providers has to be loaded once with the method AddProvider() to the BusinessTransActionManager class on app start. After usage the IBusinessTransactionProvider implementations are removed from memory. Only the transactions loaded stay in the memory. internal class TestBusinessTransactionProvider: IBusinessTransactionProvider { /// <summary> /// Default ctor /// </summary> public TestBusinessTransactionProvider(SampleBusinessLogicLayer sampleBusinessLogicLayer) { SampleBusinessLogic = sampleBusinessLogicLayer; CreateBusinessTransactionDelegates.Add(1000, CreateTnr1000); } /// <summary> /// A dictionary containing delegates for creating business transactions. /// The key of the dictionary is the int tarnsaction ID /// </summary> public Dictionary<int, CreateBusinessTransactionDelegate> CreateBusinessTransactionDelegates { get; } = new(); /// <summary> /// Business logic dependency /// </summary> public SampleBusinessLogicLayer SampleBusinessLogic { get; } /// <summary> /// Create business transcation 1000.

See typical examples here: /// <summary> /// Helper method to set up provider. May require mocking of dependencies /// </summary> /// <returns></returns> private static TestBusinessTransactionProvider CreateProvider() { var dependency = new SampleBusinessLogicLayer(); var prov = new TestBusinessTransactionProvider(dependency); return prov; } [Test] public void CheckAll_ValidSetup_Success() { // Arrange var prov = CreateProvider(); // Act foreach (var item in prov.CreateBusinessTransactionDelegates) { var transaction = item.Value.Invoke(); Assert.That(item.Key, Is.EqualTo(transaction.Id)); } } [Test] public void CreateBusinessTransactionDelegates_DefaultSetup_ReturnsTransaction() { // Arrange const int tnr = 1000; var prov = CreateProvider(); // Act prov.CreateBusinessTransactionDelegates.TryGetValue(tnr, out var test); prov = null; // Kill the provider to see if the static delegate method is called correctly // Assert Assert.That(test, Is.Not.Null); var result = test.Invoke(); Assert.That(result, Is.Not.Null); } [Test] public void Ctor_ValidSetup_Success() { // Arrange var dependency = new SampleBusinessLogicLayer(); // Act var prov = new TestBusinessTransactionProvider(dependency); // Assert Assert.That(prov.SampleBusinessLogic, Is.Not.Null); Assert.That(prov.SampleBusinessLogic, Is.SameAs(dependency)); } [Test] public void Transaction1000_TestTransaction_ValidSetup_Success() { // Arrange var prov = CreateProvider(); // Act var result = prov.CreateTnr1000(); // Assert Assert.That(result, Is.Not.Null); Assert.That(result.Id, Is.EqualTo(1000)); Assert.That(result.RunBusinessTransactionDelegate, Is.Not.Null); Assert.That(result.AllowedRequestDataTypes.Count, Is.Not.EqualTo(0)); } Here a simple example how to set up and to use the business transactions: // Arrange var aes = TestHelper.CreateAppEventSource(); const int transactionId = 1000; var m = new BusinessTransactionManager(_logger, aes); var p = new TestTransactionProvider(); m.AddProvider(p); IBusinessTransactionRequestData requestData = new EmptyBusinessTransactionRequestData(); // Act var t = m.RunBusinessTransaction(transactionId, requestData); // Assert Assert.That(t, Is.Not.Null); Assert.That(m.TransactionCache, Has.Count.EqualTo(1)); Assert.That(t.RequestData, Is.EqualTo(requestData)); Sample implementation of a business transaction loader handling multiple business transaction providers If you have multiple providers for business transactions you should implement IBusinessTransactionLoader. It allows easier handling of multiple espacially if using a DI container. After usage the IBusinessTransactionLoader and IBusinessTransactionProvider implementations are removed from memory. Only the transactions loaded stay in the memory. internal class TestBusinessTransactionLoader: IBusinessTransactionLoader { /// <summary> /// Default ctor /// </summary> public TestBusinessTransactionLoader(IBusinessTransactionManager businessTransactionManager, SampleBusinessLogicLayer sampleBusinessLogicLayer) { BusinessTransactionManager = businessTransactionManager; SampleBusinessLogic = sampleBusinessLogicLayer; } /// <summary> /// Current <see cref=\"IBusinessTransactionManager\"/> impl to load the providers in /// </summary> public IBusinessTransactionManager BusinessTransactionManager { get; } /// <summary> /// Business logic dependency /// </summary> public SampleBusinessLogicLayer SampleBusinessLogic { get; } /// <summary> /// Load the providers /// </summary> public void LoadProviders() { var provider = new TestBusinessTransactionProvider(SampleBusinessLogic); BusinessTransactionManager.AddProvider(provider); // Add more providers } } Here an example how to use the IBusinessTransactionLoader instance: // Arrange var aes = TestHelper.CreateAppEventSource(); var logger = TestHelper.GetFakeAppLoggerProxy(); const int transactionId = 1000; var m = new BusinessTransactionManager(logger, aes); var dependency = new SampleBusinessLogicLayer(); var p = new TestBusinessTransactionLoader(m, dependency); p.LoadProviders(); IBusinessTransactionRequestData requestData = new EmptyBusinessTransactionRequestData(); // Act var t = m.RunBusinessTransaction(transactionId, requestData); // Assert Assert.That(t, Is.Not.Null); Assert.That(m.TransactionCache, Has.Count.EqualTo(1)); Assert.That(t.RequestData, Is.EqualTo(requestData));"

    "summary": "Client notifications In a client server environment the server (or the client) may send notifications to the client (or server). The notifications are transported via GRPC, REST or any other transport layer technology. The client notifications system implemented in Bodoconsult.App is working one way. A client intended to receive notifications from the server has to login at the server. The login is handled by the IClientManager instance (normally a ClientManager instance). The IClientManager instance handles all clients and is responsible to forward the notifications created by the server to the clients logged in and intended to receive the notification. If you need bidirectional notifications you can implement the client notifications system on both sides the server and the client. Implement your notifcations based on IClientNotification as required Here a simple sample notification: /// <summary> /// Test notification /// </summary> public class TestNotification : IClientNotification { /// <summary> /// Any message to transfer to the client /// </summary> public string Message { get; set; } public object NotificationObjectToSend { get; set; } } Implement an IClientNotificationLicenseManager instance Purpose of the IClientNotificationLicenseManager instance is to check if a certain type of client has permission to access client notifications. Implement your own IClientNotificationLicenseManager implementation or use DummyClientNotificationLicenseManager if no license check is required. Implement an IClientMessagingService instance The ClientMessagingService instance is intended to convert the internal notification object to the data transfer object used to sent the notification content via the transportation layer to the client. /// <summary> /// Sample implementation of <see cref=\"IClientMessagingService\"/> /// </summary> public class FakeClientMessagingService : IClientMessagingService { /// <summary> /// Default ctor: should load all required conversion rules /// </summary> public FakeClientMessagingService() { ConversionRules.Add(nameof(TestNotification), ConvertToTestTransportLayerObject); } /// <summary> /// Converts a <see cref=\"TestNotification\"/> to a <see cref=\"TestTransportLayerObject\"/> /// </summary> /// <param name=\"notification\">Notifications</param> /// <returns>A <see cref=\"TestTransportLayerObject\"/> instance</returns> /// <remarks>Method should be public for unit testing</remarks> /// <exception cref=\"ArgumentException\">Throws if the type of notification is not <see cref=\"TestNotification\"/></exception> public object ConvertToTestTransportLayerObject(IClientNotification notification) { if (notification is not TestNotification testNotification) { throw new ArgumentException(\"Wrong type of exeception. TestNotification is expected.\"); } return new TestTransportLayerObject { Message = testNotification.Message }; } /// <summary> /// All conversion rules for notifications event args to client transport level target object /// </summary> public Dictionary<string, NotificationToTargetTransferObjectDelegate> ConversionRules { get; } = new(); /// <summary> /// Convert a notification into a client transport level target object /// </summary> /// <param name=\"notification\">Current notification to send</param> /// <returns>Object to transfer to the client on transport level</returns> public object Convert(IClientNotification notification) { var typeName = notification.GetType().Name; var success = ConversionRules.TryGetValue(typeName, out var result); if (!success) { throw new ArgumentException($\"Type not found: {typeName}\"); } return result(notification); } } Setup an ClientManager instance You can use ClientManager as default implementation of IClientManager or implement your own IClientManager implementation. [Test] public void TestCtor() { // Arrange var licManager = TestHelper.GetFakeLicenceManager(); var clientMessagingService = new FakeClientMessagingService(); // Act var cm = new ClientManager(licManager, _logger, clientMessagingService); // Assert Assert.That(cm.AllConnectedClients, Is.Not.Null); Assert.That(cm.AllConnectedClients.Count, Is.EqualTo(0)); } Login as client Now a client has to login to the IClientManager instance. Your client implementation must contain a transport layer connection to the client for sending the notification via this connection. Client implementations can allow no, all or only certain notfications to be sent to the client represented by this implementations. Add all (or none) names of the internal notification implementations to the IClient.AllowedNotifications property. [Test] public void TestAddClientFull() { // Arrange var licManager = TestHelper.GetFakeLicenceManager(); var clientMessagingService = new FakeClientMessagingService(); var cm = new ClientManager(licManager, _logger, clientMessagingService); Assert.That(cm.AllConnectedClients, Is.Not.Null); Assert.That(cm.AllConnectedClients.Count, Is.EqualTo(0)); var client = new FakeClient { ClientData = new FakeLoginData { Type = (int)MyClientTypeEnum.Full } }; // Act cm.AddClient(client); // Assert Assert.That(cm.AllConnectedClients.Count, Is.EqualTo(1)); } Remark: IClientManager.AddClient does not check if the client is allowed to login. You have to implement your own authentification if needed before calling IClientManager.AddClient. Send a notification to the connected client(s) Setup your ClientMessagingBusinessDelegate instance and use its DoNotifyClient() method to send a notification to the client. [Test] public void TestDoNotifyClient() { // Arrange IClientMessagingService cms = new FakeClientMessagingService(); var client = new FakeClient { ClientData = new FakeLoginData() }; var licManager = TestHelper.GetFakeLicenceManager(); var clientMessagingService = new FakeClientMessagingService(); var clientManager = new ClientManager(licManager, _logger, clientMessagingService); clientManager.AddClient(client); var cmdb = new ClientMessagingBusinessDelegate(cms, clientManager); var notification = new TestNotification(); // Act cmdb.DoNotifyClient(notification); // Assert Assert.That(cmdb.HasNotifications, Is.True); }"

    "summary": "Logging with IAppLoggerProxy / AppLoggerProxy Overview AppLoggerProxy is a high performance logger infrastructure for multithreaded and or multitasked apps with low resulting garbage pressure. Log entries are stored to a intermediate queue and then processed on a single thread during app runtime using a IWatchdog implementation. This avoids file access errors resulting from different threads trying to access the destinantion log at the same time. To reduce garbage pressure log entries are reused. Therefore you should use a singelton instance of a LogDataFactory for the whole app. You can store this singleton instance i.e. in a singleton IAppGlobals instance for your app. Each instance of IAppLoggerProxy is representing a separate logging target. Log entries are written to the logging target in a single threaded way to avoid trouble with accessing log file from multiple threads. Prerequisites If you get an exception similar to \"Could not load file or assembly 'Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Console, Version=9.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=adb9793829ddae60'. ...\" you need to add the following packages to your app. <PackageReference Include=\"log4net\" Version=\"3.2.0\" /> <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json\" Version=\"9.0.11\" /> <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection\" Version=\"9.0.11\" /> <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Extensions.Logging\" Version=\"9.0.11\" /> <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Console\" Version=\"9.0.11\" /> <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Debug\" Version=\"9.0.11\" /> <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.EventSource\" Version=\"9.0.11\" /> During JSON deserialization of appsettings.json this packages are required. Supported logging targets IAppLoggerProxy supports the following logging targets by default: Log4Net Console Debug window (only in debug mode) Eventlog EventSource (to use log entries in the app itself i.e. for showing it in a GUI) This logging targets can be activated seperately or in a combined manor. Combine Log4Net and EventSource in appsettings.json if you want to log to a file and to the GUI at the same time for example. Configuring central app logging in appsettings.json Central app logging with IAppLoggerProxy can be configured in the appsettings.json file. See a typical example here: { \"ConnectionStrings\": { \"DefaultConnection\": \"Data Source=(LocalDB)\\\\MSSQLLocalDb;Initial Catalog=XYDatabase;Integrated Security=true;MultipleActiveResultSets=True;App=ConsoleApp1\" }, \"Logging\": { \"MinimumLogLevel\": \"Debug\", \"LogLevel\": { \"Default\": \"Information\", \"System\": \"Information\", \"Microsoft\": \"Information\", \"Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore\": \"Warning\" }, \"Log4Net\": { \"LogLevel\": { \"Default\": \"Debug\" } }, //\"Console\": { // \"IncludeScopes\": true, // \"DisableColors\": false //}, //, \"EventLog\": { // \"SourceName\": \"MyApp\" // \"LogName\": \"MyLogName\" // \"MachineName\": \"MyMachineName\" //}, \"Debug\": { \"LogLevel\": { \"Default\": \"Debug\" } }, \"EventSource\": { \"LogLevel\": { \"Default\": \"Error\" } } } } Configuring other loggers Creating multiple logfiles If you want to setup multiple logfiles for your app for example per device the app handles you can create multiple instances of IAppLoggerProxy. See class MonitorLoggerFactory. It takes a full path for the logfile to log in and the other settings from log4net.config. Using log4net as logger If you want to use log4net for logging you can use the Log4NetLoggerFactory. var logger = new AppLoggerProxy(new Log4NetLoggerFactory.(), Globals.LogDataFactory); _log.LogWarning(\"Hallo\"); You can configure the logger with a log4net.config file in the project main folder. See log4net documentation for details. Fake logger for unit tests For unit tests you can use a fake implementation of a logger. It logs to the output window only. var logger = new AppLoggerProxy(new FakeLoggerFactory(), Globals.LogDataFactory); _log.LogWarning(\"Hallo\");"

Timers do have the potential issue with multiple running tasks if tasks may run longer than the timer interval. So if your timer task will potentially run longer then the timer interval you should think about using IWatchDog implementations. The runner method is fired and processed until done. Then the watchdog waits for the delay interval until it restarts the runner method. For time critical tasks WatchDog is not a good solution. If you have to ensure that your task is running i.e. every minute exactly, you better should use a Timer. The runner method is running always on the same separated background thread. WatchDogRunnerDelegate runner = Runner; var w = new WatchDog(runner, delayTime); w.StartWatchDog(); ... w.StopWatchDog(); /// <summary> /// Runner method for the watchdog /// </summary> private void Runner() { // Do your tasks here } BufferPool<T> BufferPool<T> is used to handle and reuse multiple instances of potentially small objects of a type to reduce garbage pressure. Heavily used small objects of a type lead to a relatively high demand for object creation and disposing. In such cases it might be a good idea to reuse the already created instances. Classes used with BufferPool<T> should implement IResetable interface. // Arrange var myPool = new BufferPool<byte[]>(() => new byte[65535]); myPool.Allocate(1000); var buffer = myPool.Dequeue(); // Act myPool.Enqueue(buffer); // Assert Assert.That(myPool.LengthOfQueue, Is.EqualTo(NumberOfItems)); ProducerConsumerQueue ProducerConsumerQueue implements the producer-consumer-pattern for one or many producers but only one consumer with running the consumer always on the same thread. This may be helpful if the consumer is maybe a database or a file which should not be accessed by multiple threads at the same time. const string s1 = \"Blubb\"; const string s2 = \"Blabb\"; const string s3 = \"Blobb\"; var pc = new ProducerConsumerQueue<string>(); pc.ConsumerTaskDelegate = ConsumerTaskDelegate; pc.StartConsumer(); // Act pc.Enqueue(s1); pc.Enqueue(s2); pc.Enqueue(s3); // Assert Wait.Until(() => _counter > 0); Assert.That(_counter, Is.EqualTo(3)); Assert.That(_received.Count, Is.EqualTo(3)); Assert.That(_received.Contains(s1), Is.True); Assert.That(_received.Contains(s2), Is.True); Assert.That(_received.Contains(s3), Is.True); ... private void ConsumerTaskDelegate(string value) { _counter++; _received.Add(value); _wasFired = true; } Data protection DataProtectionManager for protecting secrets like credentials DataProtectionManager implements a file based solution for save storage of sensitive data based on Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection to be used in console apps etc. without the need of more sophisticated tools like Azure Vault etc.. Important: unprotecting data is possible only on the machine the data protection was done. Using without DI container See the following example for how to use DataProtectionManager without DI container: [Test] public void Unprotect_ValidSetup_SecretUnprotectedCorrectly() { // Arrange var path = Globals.Instance.AppStartParameter.DataPath; var instance = DataProtectionService.CreateInstance(path, AppName); var filePath = Path.Combine(path, $\"appData.{Extension}\"); if (File.Exists(filePath)) { File.Delete(filePath); } var dpm = new DataProtectionManager(instance, FileProtectionService, filePath); dpm.Protect(Key, Secret); // Act var result = dpm.Unprotect(Key); // Assert Assert.That(result, Is.EqualTo(Secret)); dpm.Dispose(); } Using with DI container See the following example for how to use DataProtectionManager without DI container: private static SimpleDataProtectionDiContainerServiceProvider CreateProvider() { var destinationFolderPath = TestHelper.TempPath; var provider = new SimpleDataProtectionDiContainerServiceProvider(destinationFolderPath); return provider; } [Test] public void CreateInstance_DefaultSetup_InstanceCreated() { // Arrange var filePath = Path.Combine(TestHelper.TempPath, \"blubb.dat\"); var provider = CreateProvider(); var container = new DiContainer(); Assert.That(container.ServiceCollection.Count, Is.EqualTo(0)); provider.AddServices(container); container.BuildServiceProvider(); Assert.That(container.ServiceCollection.Count, Is.Not.EqualTo(0)); var dpm = container.Get<IDataProtectionManagerFactory>(); Assert.That(dpm, Is.Not.Null); // Act var instance = dpm.CreateInstance(filePath); // Assert Assert.That(instance, Is.Not.Null); } There is another implementation NoDataProtectionDiContainerServiceProvider of IDiContainerServiceProvider to load a data protection solution letting the file itself unprotected but not the secrets stored in the file. Please use SimpleDataProtectionDiContainerServiceProvider normally. Protecting entities: EntityProtectionService class If you want to protect properties of an entity use EntityProtectionService class. You have to prepare your entity class with two attributes DataProtectionKey and DataProtectionSecret: internal class EntityWithUidWithSecrets { [DataProtectionKey] public Guid Uid { get; set; } [DataProtectionSecret] public string Secret { get; set; } [DataProtectionSecret] public string Secret2 { get; set; } } The DataProtectionKey attribute has to be set once. The following sample shows how to use private readonly EntityProtectionService _entityProtectionService; protected const string AppName = \"MyApp\"; public EntityProtectionServiceTests() { var path = Globals.Instance.AppStartParameter.DataPath; var dataProtectionService = DataProtectionService.CreateInstance(path, AppName); _entityProtectionService = new EntityProtectionService(dataProtectionService); } [Test] public void Unprotect_MultipleSecretsWithUid_PropsWithDataProtectionSecretAttributeProtected() { // Arrange const string secret = \"Secret\"; const string secret2 = \"Secret2\"; var uid = Guid.NewGuid(); var entity = new EntityWithUidWithSecrets { Uid = uid, Secret = secret, Secret2 = secret2 }; _entityProtectionService.Protect(entity); Assert.That(entity.Uid, Is.EqualTo(uid)); Assert.That(entity.Secret, Is.Not.EqualTo(secret)); Assert.That(entity.Secret2, Is.Not.EqualTo(secret2)); Assert.That(entity.Secret, Is.Not.EqualTo(entity.Secret2)); // Act _entityProtectionService.Unprotect(entity); // Assert Assert.That(entity.Uid, Is.EqualTo(uid)); Assert.That(entity.Secret, Is.EqualTo(secret)); Assert.That(entity.Secret2, Is.EqualTo(secret2)); } IExceptionReplyBuilder / ExceptionReplyBuilder ExceptionReplyBuilder delivers a central exception management to be used standalone or in conjunction with business transactions.

    "summary": "Dependency injection (DI) container DiContainer Learn basics on dependency injection () Constructor injection Service locator style of injection Method injection How to use DiContainer class: the simple way How to use DiContainer class: organize your DI with IDiContainerServiceProvider interface IDiContainerServiceProvider implementations in Bodoconsult.App.Infrastructure repo BasicAppServicesConfig1ContainerServiceProvider BasicAppServicesConfig2ContainerServiceProvider ApmDiContainerServiceProvider Basics on dependency injection (DI) Dependency injection makes loose coupling of classes possible. The main question is: how do I get my required dependencies in a class from outside the class. Benefits of using DI are: Helps in unit testing. Boiler plate code is reduced, as initializing of dependencies is done by the injector component. Extending the application becomes easier. Helps to enable loose coupling, which is important in application programming. There are basically three types of dependency injection: constructor injection: the dependencies are provided through a class constructor. setter injection: the client exposes a setter method that the injector uses to inject the dependency. interface injection: the dependency provides an injector method that will inject the dependency into any client passed to it. Clients must implement an interface that exposes a setter method that accepts the dependency. Service locator style of injection may be called a type of dependency injection too but its usage isn't recommend (see below). The purpose of a dependency injection container class like DiContainer is to resolve the dependencies injected by constructur when a class is instanciated. Constructor injection The dependencies of a class are injected via the constructor of a class. This is the preferred way on dependency injection. // Using default spellchecker IEngine engine = new XEngine() var carWithEngineX = new Car(engine) // Using another spellchecker engine = new YEngine() var carWithEngineY = new Car(engine) // Using a fake for testing engine = new FakeEngine() var carWithFakeEngine = new Car(engine) Service locator style of injection Via a central dependency manager like DiContainer class a required dependency is resolved from inside the class: var instance = DiContainer.Get<ICar>() This type of dependency injection works but is not very transparent from outside the class. Therefore it should by avoided and replaced by constructor injection or method injection. Method injection Method dependency injection you normally do not need very often. You may need it if you have circular references if loading dependencies via ctor(). This may happen .e.e. if to classes are dependent on each other. Normally this should be avoided by class design but under rare circumstances especially during refatoring projects this may happen. private IEngine _engine; public void InjectDependecy(IEngine engine) { _engine = engine; } How to use DiContainer class: the simple way Normally the DiContainer class is a central static singleton class. If you use Bodoconsult.App you can store the DiContainer instance in your implementation of IAppGlobals. There is a proeprty DiContainer for it. Easiest but in larger projects not the best way of setting up the services delivered the DiContainer is as follows: [Test] public void BuildServiceProvider_DefaultSetup_ServicesAddedAndServiceProviderBuilt() { // Arrange var diContainer = new DiContainer(); Assert.That(diContainer.ServiceCollection.Count, Is.EqualTo(0)); // Now add the services provided by a MS builder class var builder = diContainer.ServiceCollection.AddDataProtection() .SetApplicationName(\"TestApp\") .PersistKeysToFileSystem(new DirectoryInfo(TestHelper.TempPath)) ; if (RuntimeInformation.IsOSPlatform(OSPlatform.Windows)) { builder.ProtectKeysWithDpapi(); } // Add your own classes diContainer.AddSingleton<IFileProtectionService, NoFileProtectionService>(); diContainer.AddSingleton<IDataProtectionServiceFactory, DataProtectionServiceFactory>(); diContainer.AddSingleton<IDataProtectionManagerFactory, DataProtectionManagerFactory>(); // Act diContainer.BuildServiceProvider(); // Assert Assert.That(diContainer.ServiceCollection.Count, Is.Not.EqualTo(0)); Assert.That(diContainer.ServiceProvider, Is.Not.Null); // Try to use an instance var dpm = diContainer.Get<IDataProtectionManagerFactory>(); Assert.That(dpm, Is.Not.Null); } How to use DiContainer class: organize your DI with IDiContainerServiceProvider interface In the above sample you see all required services added line by line. This may lead to a complex method loading the required services in the DI container. /// <summary> /// Interface for classes adding DI container services to a DI container /// </summary> public interface IDiContainerServiceProvider { /// <summary> /// Add DI container services to a DI container /// </summary> /// <param name=\"diContainer\">Current DI container</param> void AddServices(DiContainer diContainer); /// <summary> /// Late bind DI container references to avoid circular DI references /// </summary> /// <param name=\"diContainer\">Current DI container</param> void LateBindObjects(DiContainer diContainer); } Implement a provider based on IDiContainerServiceProvider to load your dependencies as required. /// <summary> /// Load all specific WpfConsoleApp1 services to DI container.

    "summary": "Bodoconsult.Charting What does Bodoconsult.Charting library Bodoconsult.Charting is a library for creating charts from database data. Here a sample chart created with Bodoconsult.Charting: The workflow for using the library is generally as follows: Getting data as DataTable from a database Create a ChartData object to make general settings for the chart and load the data from the DataTable as list of IChartItemData items Create a ChartHandler and deliver the ChartData object to it Export the data to a file To work properly the DataTable objects must have a certain logical structure depending on the type of chart you want to create. Chart data input Style the charts Creating charts Line charts Bar chart Column chart Stacked bar chart Stacked column chart Stacked column chart 100 percent Pie chart Point chart Using Bodoconsult.Charting in a DI container environment Extension methods for charting How to use the library The source code contains NUnit test classes the following source code is extracted from. The samples below show the most helpful use cases for the library. Chart data input All chart types require a IList as input. The following classes are implementing IChartItemData currently: ChartItemData PieChartItemData PointChartItemData See the description for each chart type below for the required type of data input. Style the charts Chart styling is based on the class ChartStyle from the library Bodoconsult.App.Abstractions you can download via Nuget. See the following code fragments for how chart styling is done in the test project. public static class TestHelper { ... /// <summary> /// Load a default style for the charts /// </summary> /// <param name=\"chartData\"></param> /// <param name=\"highResolution\"></param> public static void LoadDefaultChartStyle(ChartData chartData, bool highResolution = false) { var chartStyle = GlobalValues.DefaultTypography().ChartStyle; if (highResolution) { chartStyle.Width = 4500; chartStyle.Height = 2781; chartStyle.FontSize = 12; } chartStyle.CopyrightFontSizeDelta = 0.6F; chartStyle.BackgroundColor = Color.Transparent; //_chartStyle.AxisLineColor = Color.DarkBlue; // chartData.ChartStyle = chartStyle; chartData.Copyright = \"(c) Testfirma\"; } ... } public static class GlobalValues { /// <summary> /// Get a elegant default typography /// </summary> /// <returns></returns> public static ITypography DefaultTypography() { var typography = new ElegantTypographyPageHeader(\"Calibri\", \"Calibri\", \"Calibri\") { ChartStyle = { Width = 750, Height = 464, FontSize = 10, BackGradientStyle = GradientStyle.TopBottom, } }; return typography; } } Creating charts Line chart Sample image Chart data ChartItemData class /// <summary> /// Data items for line charts, stacked bar charts and others. /// </summary> public class ChartItemData : IChartItemData { /// <summary> /// Value for the x axis /// </summary> public double XValue { get; set; } /// <summary> /// Value for the data series 1 /// </summary> public double YValue1 { get; set; } /// <summary> /// Value for the data series 2 /// </summary> public double YValue2 { get; set; } /// <summary> /// Value for the data series 3 /// </summary> public double YValue3 { get; set; } /// <summary> /// Value for the data series 4 /// </summary> public double YValue4 { get; set; } /// <summary> /// Value for the data series 5 /// </summary> public double YValue5 { get; set; } /// <summary> /// Value for the data series 6 /// </summary> public double YValue6 { get; set; } /// <summary> /// Value for the data series 7 /// </summary> public double YValue7 { get; set; } /// <summary> /// Value for the data series 8 /// </summary> public double YValue8 { get; set; } /// <summary> /// Value for the data series 9 /// </summary> public double YValue9 { get; set; } /// <summary> /// Value for the data series 10 /// </summary> public double YValue10 { get; set; } /// <summary> /// Are x axis values dates? /// </summary> public bool IsDate { get; set; } /// <summary> /// Label to show for the item.

    "summary": "Bodoconsult.I18N What does the library Basic ideas Bodoconsult.I18N library is a simple localization library based on I18N-Portable https://github.com/xleon/I18N-Portable by Diego Ponce de León (xleon). To use I18N-Portable directly was not possible for us. We required a localization library supporting resources from multiple assemblies and sources. We had to not only localize a WPF UI but report generation to PDF files and localized charting to images. The localization resources used for all this were spread of multiple assemblies and in different file formats. This led us to the need of a unique localization implementation usable in multiple environments like WinForms, WPF, console or Avalonia apps. I18N-Portable did not support this. But the general idea of I18N-Portable is cool. Therefore we decided to develop an own I18N-Portable derivative with similar published interfaces but working a bit different behind the scenes. So the basic idea of Bodoconsult.I18N library is to simplify the usage of multiple technologies existing for localization like RESX resources and XAML resource dictionary under one roof. Bodoconsult.I18N library currently supports I18N for apps with one currently loaded language at a time only but this language can be changed during runtime. Apps with multiple UI threads running on different languages are not supported currently. Our implementation was intended for using it with console apps, WinForms apps or WPF apps under .Net8 or later. All other uses case may work but are not tested. Usable with a DI container Simple initialization setup Readable and lean locale files (UTF8 .txt with key/value pairs) Support for custom file formats via ILocalesProvider interface (json, xml, etc) Light weight Well tested Localization data sources Bodoconsult.I18N supports the following localization sources hosted maybe in different assemblies: TXT files CSV files JSON key value pairs files Resx resource files Embedded or external XAML resource files (.xaml extension) for WPF (additional Nuget package Bodoconsult.App.Wpf is required) External AXAML resource files (.axaml extension) for Avalonia (additional Nuget package Bodoconsult.App.Avalonia is required) Implementing your own implemenation of IResourceProvider normally by deriving from BaseResourceProvider class you can implement your own localization provider based providing localization data from diverse source like file, databases, web resources via REST etc.. How to use the library The source code contains NUnit test classes, the following source code samples are extracted from. The samples below show the most helpful use cases for the library. Setup locales In your Net8 project, create a directory called \"Locales\". Create a {languageCode}.txt file for each language you want to support. languageCode can be a two letter ISO code or a IETF culture name like \"en-US\" or \"de-DE\". See full list here. Set \"Build Action\" to \"Embedded Resource\" on the properties of each file For available file formats see File formats for locales Locale content sample # key = value (the key will be the same across locales) one = uno two = dos three = tres four = cuatro five = cinco # Enums are supported Animals.Dog = Perro Animals.Cat = Gato Animals.Rat = Rata Animals.Tiger = Tigre Animals.Monkey = Mono # Support for string.Format() stars.count = Tienes {0} estrellas TextWithLineBreakCharacters = Line One\\nLine Two\\r\\nLine Three Multiline = Line One Line Two Line Three Fluent initialization I18N.Current .SetNotFoundSymbol(\"$\") // Optional: when a key is not found, it will appear as $key$ (defaults to \"$\") .SetFallbackLocale(\"en\") // Optional but recommended: locale to load in case the system locale is not supported .SetThrowWhenKeyNotFound(true) // Optional: Throw an exception when keys are not found (recommended only for debugging) .SetLogger(text => Debug.WriteLine(text)) // action to output traces Using I18N without depencency injection The following code does not use Fluent to show the single steps necessary. It may be shortene by using Fluent. // **** Load all resources from one or more sources **** // Add provider 1 ILocalesProvider provider = new I18NEmbeddedResourceLocalesProvider(GetType().Assembly, \"Bodoconsult.I18N.Test.Samples.Locales\"); I18N.Current.AddProvider(provider); // Add provider 2 provider = new I18NEmbeddedResourceLocalesProvider(GetType().Assembly, \"Bodoconsult.I18N.Test.Locales\"); I18N.Current.AddProvider(provider); Assert.IsTrue(I18N.Current.Languages.Any()); // **** Initialize all **** // Set a fallback locale for the case current thread language is not available in the resources I18N.Current.SetFallbackLocale(\"en\"); // Load the default language from thread culture I18N.Current.Init(); // **** Use it **** // change to spanish (not necessary if thread language is ok) I18N.Current.Locale = \"es\"; var translation = I18N.Current.Translate(\"one\"); Assert.AreEqual(\"uno\", translation); translation = \"Contains\".Translate(); Assert.AreEqual(\"Contains\", translation); // Change to english I18N.Current.Locale = \"en\"; translation = I18N.Current.Translate(\"one\"); Assert.AreEqual(\"one\", translation); translation = \"Contains\".Translate(); Assert.AreEqual(\"Contains\", translation); Using I18N with depencency injection and Bodoconsult.App.Abstractions.DiContainer class Create your I18N factory based on BaseI18NFactory class The I18N factories based on BaseI18NFactory class are intended to create fully configured I18N instances with all locales loaded as required by your app. To configure the I18N instance create an override for method CreateInstance() loading all providers as required. /// <summary> /// Factory to create a fully configured I18N factory /// </summary> public class TestI18NFactory: BaseI18NFactory { /// <summary> /// Creating a configured II18N instance /// </summary> /// <returns>An II18N instance</returns> public override II18N CreateInstance() { // Set the fallback language I18NInstance.SetFallbackLocale(\"en\"); // Load a provider var provider = new I18NEmbeddedResourceLocalesProvider(TestHelper.CurrentAssembly, \"Bodoconsult.I18N.Test.Samples.Locales\"); I18NInstance.AddProvider(provider); // Load more providers if necessary // ... // Init instance with language from running thread I18NInstance.Init(); // Return the instance return I18NInstance; } } If you use Bodoconsult.App app start infrastructure you can add the DI related code to the implementation of the method IDiContainerServiceProvider.AddServices as shown here in the sample: namespace AvaloniaApp1.DiContainerProvider; /// <summary> /// Load all specific AvaloniaApp1 services to DI container. Intended mainly for production /// </summary> public class AvaloniaApp1AllServicesContainerServiceProvider : IDiContainerServiceProvider { ... /// <summary> /// Add DI container services to a DI container /// </summary> /// <param name=\"diContainer\">Current DI container</param> public void AddServices(DiContainer diContainer) { // Factories to create tower instance related objects (should be singletons) diContainer.AddSingletonInstance(Globals.Instance.LogDataFactory); diContainer.AddSingleton<IAppLoggerProxyFactory, AppLoggerProxyFactory>(); // benchmark var benchProxy = AppBenchProxy.CreateAppBenchProxy(_benchmarkFileName, Globals.Instance.LogDataFactory); diContainer.AddSingletonInstance(benchProxy); // General app management diContainer.AddSingleton<IGeneralAppManagementService, GeneralAppManagementService>(); diContainer.AddSingleton<IGeneralAppManagementManager, GeneralAppManagementManager>(); // I18N II18NFactory i18NFactory = new I18NFactory(); diContainer.AddSingleton(i18NFactory.CreateInstance()); // Load all other services required for the app now diContainer.AddSingleton<IApplicationService, AvaloniaApp1Service>(); // ... } ... } Data binding I18N implements INotifyPropertyChanged and it has an indexer to translate keys. For instance, you could translate a key like: string three = I18N.Current[\"three\"]; With that said, the easiest way to bind your views to I18N translations is to use the built-in indexer by creating a proxy object in your ViewModel: public abstract class BaseViewModel { public II18N TranslationService => I18N.Current; } WPF Xaml sample <Button Content=\"{Binding TranslationService[key]}\" /> key is an existing key in a locales file. See MainForm.xaml in WpfApp1 project in the repository. Avalonia XAML sample <Button Text=\"{Binding TranslationService[key]}\" /> key is an existing key in a locales file. See MainForm.axaml in AvaloniaApp1 project in the repository. Xamarin.Forms sample <Button Text=\"{Binding TranslationService[key]}\" />` key is an existing key in a locales file. WinForms sample WinForms does not support data binding to a indexer. Therefore you have to create a (readonly) property for each control containing translated text. /// <summary> /// ViewModel for alternative main window Form1 /// </summary> public class WinFormsApp1MainWindowViewModel : MainWindowViewModel { ... /// <summary> /// Property for binding to Text prop of label TranslationLabel /// </summary> public string TranslationLabelText => TranslationService.Translate(\"Contains\"); ... } See Form1 in WinFormsApp1 project in the repository. Locales file formats For all file formats currently implemented with Bodoconsult.I18N there are samples in the Bodoconsult.I18N.Test project in the repository. Plain text files (.txt) one = one two = two three = three Mailbox.Notification = Hello {0}, you've got {1} emails TextWithLineBreakCharacters = Line One\\nLine Two\\r\\nLine Three Multiline = Line One Line Two Line Three Animals = List of animals Animals.Dog = Dog Animals.Cat = Cat Animals.Rat = Rat Animals.Snake = Good\\nSnake Fruit.Orange = great orange Fruit.Apple = big apple Fruit.Banana = nice banana CSV text files one;one two;two three;three Mailbox.Notification;Hello {0}, you've got {1} emails TextWithLineBreakCharacters;Line One\\nLine Two\\nLine Three Animals;List of animals Animals.Dog;Dog Animals.Cat;Cat Animals.Rat;Rat Animals.Snake;Good\\nSnake Fruit.Orange;great orange Fruit.Apple;big apple Fruit.Banana;nice banana JSON key-value-pairs file { \"one\": \"one\", \"two\": \"two\", \"three\": \"three\", \"Mailbox.Notification\": \"Hello {0}, you've got {1} emails\", \"TextWithLineBreakCharacters\": \"Line One\\nLine Two\\nLine Three\", \"Animals\": \"List of animals\", \"Animals.Dog\": \"Dog\", \"Animals.Cat\": \"Cat\", \"Animals.Rat\": \"Rat\", \"Animals.Snake\": \"Good\\nSnake\", \"Fruit.Orange\": \"great orange\", \"Fruit.Apple\": \"big apple\", \"Fruit.Banana\": \"nice banana\" } JSON list file [ { \"key\": \"one\", \"value\": \"one\" }, { \"key\": \"two\", \"value\": \"two\" }, { \"key\": \"three\", \"value\": \"three\" }, { \"key\": \"Mailbox.Notification\", \"value\": \"Hello {0}, you've got {1} emails\" }, { \"key\": \"TextWithLineBreakCharacters\", \"value\": \"Line One\\nLine Two\\nLine Three\" }, { \"key\": \"Animals\", \"value\": \"List of animals\" }, { \"key\": \"Animals.Dog\", \"value\": \"Dog\" }, { \"key\": \"Animals.Cat\", \"value\": \"Cat\" }, { \"key\": \"Animals.Rat\", \"value\": \"Rat\" }, { \"key\": \"Animals.Snake\", \"value\": \"Good\\nSnake\" }, { \"key\": \"Fruit.Orange\", \"value\": \"great orange\" }, { \"key\": \"Fruit.Apple\", \"value\": \"big apple\" }, { \"key\": \"Fruit.Banana\", \"value\": \"nice banana\" } ] WPF XAML file as embedded resource or external file <ResourceDictionary xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation\" xmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\" xmlns:system=\"clr-namespace:System;assembly=mscorlib\"> <system:String x:Key=\"Simulation.Asset\">Asset</system:String> <system:String x:Key=\"Simulation.Distribution\">Distribution</system:String> <system:String x:Key=\"Simulation.Parameter1\">Parameter 1</system:String> <system:String x:Key=\"Simulation.Parameter2\">Parameter 2</system:String> <system:String x:Key=\"Simulation.Parameter3\">Parameter 3</system:String> <system:String x:Key=\"Simulation.Percentage\">Percentage</system:String> </ResourceDictionary> Avalonia XAML file only as external file For AvaloniaResource files there is currently no way to read the key value pairs.

DocumentBuilder class LDML is a markup language to define the content of structured text documents with paragraphs, headings, images, figures etc.. With the help of renderers the LDML markup can be translated into file formats like HTML, TXT and PDF. Central class for using LDML in C# is the DocumentBuilder class. For more details see LDML based document creation. StructuredText class Export as HTML without template (HtmlTextFormatter class) var sr = new StructuredText(); sr.AddHeader1(\"Überschrift 1 '& &&&' \"); sr.AddParagraph(MassText, \"CssTestFixture\"); sr.AddDefinitionListLine(\"Def1\", \"Value1\"); sr.AddDefinitionListLine(\"Definition 2\", \"Value1234\"); sr.AddDefinitionListLine(\"Defini 3\", \"Value234556666\"); sr.AddParagraph(string.Empty); sr.AddParagraph(FormattedMasstext, \"CssTestFixture\"); sr.AddCode(MassText, \"CssTestFixture\"); sr.AddParagraph(MassText); sr.AddListItem(\"Bahnhof\"); sr.AddListItem(\"HauptBahnhof\"); sr.AddListItem(\"SüdBahnhof\"); sr.AddHeader2(\"Überschrift 2\"); sr.AddParagraph(MassText); sr.AddParagraph(MassText); sr.AddHeader2(\"Überschrift 2\"); sr.AddParagraph(MassText); sr.AddHeader1(\"Überschrift 1\"); sr.AddParagraph(MassText); sr.AddParagraph(MassText); sr.AddParagraph(MassText); sr.AddHeader2(\"Überschrift 2\"); sr.AddParagraph(MassText); sr.AddParagraph(MassText); sr.AddParagraph(MassText); sr.AddParagraph(MassText); sr.AddHeader2(\"Überschrift 2\"); sr.AddParagraph(MassText); sr.AddHeader1(\"Überschrift 1\"); sr.AddParagraph(MassText); sr.AddParagraph(MassText); var f = new HtmlTextFormatter { StructuredText = sr }; f.GetFormattedText(); f.SaveAsFile(fileName); Export as HTML with a individual template (HtmlTextFormatter class) var sr = new StructuredText(); sr.AddHeader1(\"Überschrift 'Databanka'\"); sr.AddParagraph(MassText); sr.AddDefinitionListLine(\"Def1\", \"Value1\"); sr.AddDefinitionListLine(\"Definition 2\", \"Value1234\"); sr.AddDefinitionListLine(\"Defini 3\", \"Value234556666\"); sr.AddParagraph(string.Empty); sr.AddParagraph(MassText); sr.AddListItem(\"Bahnhof\"); sr.AddListItem(\"HauptBahnhof\"); sr.AddListItem(\"SüdBahnhof\"); sr.AddHeader2(\"Überschrift 2\"); sr.AddParagraph(MassText); sr.AddParagraph(MassText); sr.AddHeader2(\"Überschrift 2\"); sr.AddParagraph(MassText); sr.AddHeader1(\"Überschrift 1\"); sr.AddParagraph(MassText); sr.AddParagraph(MassText); sr.AddParagraph(MassText); sr.AddHeader2(\"Überschrift 2\"); sr.AddParagraph(MassText); sr.AddParagraph(MassText); sr.AddParagraph(MassText); sr.AddParagraph(MassText); sr.AddHeader2(\"Überschrift 2\"); sr.AddParagraph(MassText); sr.AddHeader1(\"Überschrift 1\"); sr.AddParagraph(MassText); sr.AddParagraph(MassText); var f = new HtmlTextFormatter { StructuredText = sr, Template = \"<<<Start>>>{0}<<<Ende>>>\", AddTableOfContent = true }; var result = f.GetFormattedText(); f.SaveAsFile(fileName); Export as plain ASCII file (PlainTextFormatter class) var sr = new StructuredText(); sr.AddHeader1(\"Überschrift 1\"); sr.AddParagraph(MassText); sr.AddDefinitionListLine(\"Def1\", \"Value1\"); sr.AddDefinitionListLine(\"Definition 2\", \"Value1234\"); sr.AddDefinitionListLine(\"Defini 3\", \"Value234556666\"); sr.AddParagraph(string.Empty); sr.AddParagraph(MassText); sr.AddListItem(\"Bahnhof\"); sr.AddListItem(\"HauptBahnhof\"); sr.AddListItem(\"SüdBahnhof\"); sr.AddHeader1(\"Überschrift 2\"); sr.AddParagraph(MassText); sr.AddParagraph(MassText); sr.AddHeader1(\"Überschrift 2\"); sr.AddParagraph(MassText); sr.AddHeader1(\"Überschrift 1\"); sr.AddParagraph(MassText); sr.AddParagraph(MassText); sr.AddParagraph(MassText); sr.AddHeader1(\"Überschrift 2\"); sr.AddParagraph(MassText); sr.AddParagraph(MassText); sr.AddParagraph(MassText); sr.AddParagraph(MassText); sr.AddHeader1(\"Überschrift 2\"); sr.AddParagraph(MassText); sr.AddHeader1(\"Überschrift 1\"); sr.AddParagraph(MassText); sr.AddParagraph(MassText); var f = new PlainTextFormatter { StructuredText = sr }; var result = f.GetFormattedText(); f.SaveAsFile(fileName); About us Bodoconsult (http://www.bodoconsult.de) is a Munich based software company.

It can run on macOS, Linux and Windows operating systems. NUnit can be used for a wide range of testing, from unit testing with TDD to full-fledged system and integration testing. It is a non-opinionated, broad and deep framework with multiple different ways to assert that your code behaves as expected. Many aspects of NUnit can be extended to suit your specific purposes. The latest version, version 4, is an upgrade from the groundbreaking NUnit 3 framework. It is a modernized version, aimed at taking advantage of the latest .NET features and C# language constructs. If you are upgrading from NUnit 3, be aware of the breaking changes (https://docs.nunit.org/articles/nunit/release-notes/breaking-changes.html#nunit-40). Please see the NUnit 4 Migration Guide (https://docs.nunit.org/articles/nunit/release-notes/Nunit4.0-MigrationGuide.html) and take care to prepare your NUnit 3 code before you do the upgrade.

Note that this package ONLY contains the adapter, not the NUnit framework. For VS 2017 and forward, you should add this package to every test project in your solution. (Earlier versions only require a single adapter package per solution.)

In case of problems with an application, it is helpful to enable logging so that the problem can be located. With log4net it is possible to enable logging at runtime without modifying the application binary. The log4net package is designed so that log statements can remain in shipped code without incurring a high performance cost. It follows that the speed of logging (or rather not logging) is crucial. At the same time, log output can be so voluminous that it quickly becomes overwhelming. One of the distinctive features of log4net is the notion of hierarchical loggers. Using these loggers it is possible to selectively control which log statements are output at arbitrary granularity. log4net is designed with two distinct goals in mind: speed and flexibility License: Apache-2.0 License-Url: https://licenses.nuget.org/Apache-2.0 Project-Url: https://github.com/apache/logging-log4net Nuget package library Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection by Microsoft ASP.NET Core logic to protect and unprotect data, similar to DPAPI.

It can run on macOS, Linux and Windows operating systems. NUnit can be used for a wide range of testing, from unit testing with TDD to full-fledged system and integration testing. It is a non-opinionated, broad and deep framework with multiple different ways to assert that your code behaves as expected. Many aspects of NUnit can be extended to suit your specific purposes. The latest version, version 4, is an upgrade from the groundbreaking NUnit 3 framework. It is a modernized version, aimed at taking advantage of the latest .NET features and C# language constructs. If you are upgrading from NUnit 3, be aware of the breaking changes (https://docs.nunit.org/articles/nunit/release-notes/breaking-changes.html#nunit-40). Please see the NUnit 4 Migration Guide (https://docs.nunit.org/articles/nunit/release-notes/Nunit4.0-MigrationGuide.html) and take care to prepare your NUnit 3 code before you do the upgrade.

The analyzers will mark wrong usages when writing tests, and the code fixes can be used to used to correct these usages. They will also aid in the transition from NUnit 3 to NUnit 4. Version 3.0 and upwards works in Visual Studio 2019 (version 16.3) or newer and also enables supression of compiler errors such as errors arising from nullable reference types. For Visual Studio 2017 one must use versions below 3.0 - note that these versions are no longer updated, so version 2.10.0 is the last version that works in Visual Studio 2017.

In case of problems with an application, it is helpful to enable logging so that the problem can be located. With log4net it is possible to enable logging at runtime without modifying the application binary. The log4net package is designed so that log statements can remain in shipped code without incurring a high performance cost. It follows that the speed of logging (or rather not logging) is crucial. At the same time, log output can be so voluminous that it quickly becomes overwhelming. One of the distinctive features of log4net is the notion of hierarchical loggers. Using these loggers it is possible to selectively control which log statements are output at arbitrary granularity. log4net is designed with two distinct goals in mind: speed and flexibility License: Apache-2.0 License-Url: https://licenses.nuget.org/Apache-2.0 Project-Url: https://github.com/apache/logging-log4net Nuget package library Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection by Microsoft ASP.NET Core logic to protect and unprotect data, similar to DPAPI.

In the above sample this is done in a separate method in the following code line for paper orientation landscape: if (landscape) LoadLandScapeSettings(styleset); Here the code of the method to set paper orientation to landscape: private void LoadLandScapeSettings(IStyleSet styleSet) { var ps = styleSet.PageSetup; ps.Orientation = Orientation.Landscape; ps.LeftMargin = Unit.FromCentimeter(1.5); ps.RightMargin = Unit.FromCentimeter(1.5); ps.TopMargin = Unit.FromCentimeter(1.5); ps.BottomMargin = Unit.FromCentimeter(1.5); var width = Unit.FromCentimeter( ps.PageHeight.Centimeter - ps.TopMargin.Centimeter - ps.BottomMargin.Centimeter); var style = styleSet.Normal; style.Font.Name = \"Arial Narrow\"; style.Font.Size = 9; // Spezielles Format für Tabellenbasis (nicht ändern!) style = styleSet.NormalTable; style.Font.Name = \"Arial Narrow\"; style.Font.Size = 8; style.ParagraphFormat.SpaceBefore = 0; style.ParagraphFormat.SpaceAfter = 0; style.ParagraphFormat.PageBreakBefore = false; style.ParagraphFormat.Alignment = ParagraphAlignment.Center; style = styleSet.Heading1; style.Font.Name = \"Arial Black\"; style.Font.Size = 12; style.Font.Color = Colors.Black; style.ParagraphFormat.PageBreakBefore = true; style.ParagraphFormat.KeepTogether = true; style.ParagraphFormat.KeepWithNext = true; style.ParagraphFormat.SpaceAfter = 2; style.ParagraphFormat.SpaceBefore = 4; style.ParagraphFormat.Alignment = ParagraphAlignment.Center; style = styleSet.Title; style.Font.Name = \"Arial Black\"; style.Font.Size = 16; style.Font.Color = Colors.Black; style.ParagraphFormat.SpaceAfter = 9; style.ParagraphFormat.SpaceBefore = 12; style.ParagraphFormat.Alignment = ParagraphAlignment.Center; style = styleSet.NoHeading1; style.Font.Name = \"Arial Black\"; style.Font.Size = 10; style.Font.Color = Colors.Black; style.ParagraphFormat.SpaceAfter = 2; style.ParagraphFormat.SpaceBefore = 4; style.ParagraphFormat.Alignment = ParagraphAlignment.Center; style = styleSet.ChartTitle; style.Font.Name = \"Arial Narrow\"; style.Font.Size = 10; style.Font.Bold = true; style.Font.Color = Colors.Black; style.ParagraphFormat.SpaceBefore = 3; style.ParagraphFormat.Alignment = ParagraphAlignment.Center; style.ParagraphFormat.SpaceAfter = 3; style = styleSet.ChartYLabel; style.Font.Name = \"Arial Narrow\"; style.Font.Size = 8; style.Font.Color = Colors.Black; style = styleSet.Toc1; style.Font.Name = \"Arial\"; style.Font.Size = 10; style.Font.Color = Colors.Black; style.ParagraphFormat.SpaceBefore = 3; style.ParagraphFormat.TabStops.ClearAll(); style.ParagraphFormat.AddTabStop(width, TabAlignment.Right); style.ParagraphFormat.SpaceAfter = 0; style.ParagraphFormat.Borders.Bottom.Width = 0; style.ParagraphFormat.Borders.Top.Width = 0; style.ParagraphFormat.Borders.Right.Width = 0; style.ParagraphFormat.Borders.Left.Width = 0; style = styleSet.TocHeading1; style.Font.Name = \"Arial Black\"; style.Font.Size = 12; style.Font.Color = Colors.Black; style.ParagraphFormat.SpaceAfter = 3; style.ParagraphFormat.SpaceAfter = 6; style.ParagraphFormat.Alignment = ParagraphAlignment.Center; // Kopfzeile style = styleSet.Header; style.Font.Name = \"Arial Narrow\"; style.Font.Size = 8; style.Font.Color = Colors.Black; style.ParagraphFormat.Alignment = ParagraphAlignment.Right; style.ParagraphFormat.SpaceAfter = Unit.FromCentimeter(0.2); style.ParagraphFormat.SpaceBefore = Unit.FromCentimeter(0.5); style.ParagraphFormat.Borders.Bottom.Width = 1; style.ParagraphFormat.Borders.Bottom.Color = Colors.Black; style = styleSet.Details; style.Font.Name = \"Arial Narrow\"; style.Font.Size = 10; style.Font.Color = Colors.Black; style.ParagraphFormat.SpaceAfter = 6; style.ParagraphFormat.Alignment = ParagraphAlignment.Center; style = styleSet.ChartCell; style.ParagraphFormat.Alignment = ParagraphAlignment.Center; style = styleSet.Footer; style.Font.Name = \"Arial Narrow\"; style.Font.Size = 8; style.Font.Color = Colors.Black; style.ParagraphFormat.Alignment = ParagraphAlignment.Left; //style.ParagraphFormat.SpaceAfter = Unit.FromCentimeter(0.5); style.ParagraphFormat.SpaceBefore = Unit.FromCentimeter(0.5); style.ParagraphFormat.TabStops.ClearAll(); style.ParagraphFormat.AddTabStop(width, TabAlignment.Right); style.ParagraphFormat.Borders.Top.Width = 1; style.ParagraphFormat.Borders.Top.Color = Colors.Black; } Remarks PdfSharp and Migradoc do not support stylesets by default- Same for PdfSharp.MigraDoc.netstandard 1.3.1. MigraDoc supports styles for styling PDF files. Bodoconsult.Core.Pdf added styleset functionality. A styleset is defined as a list of MigraDoc styles. Therefore you can use all style settings supported by MigraDoc styles. With exception of the Normal style all styles defined in a styleset are injected as new styles to the MigraDoc PDF document. The Normal style exists in a MigraDoc PDF document by default. The Normal style from the styleset therefore has to cloned to the MigraDoc PDF document. It may happen that not all properties are cloned correctly. About us Bodoconsult (http://www.bodoconsult.de) is a Munich based software company.
